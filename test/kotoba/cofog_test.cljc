;; Portability: no runtime file access, and a projection that cannot drift
;;
;; This namespace was `.clj` until 2026-08-18 — `(slurp (io/resource …))` —
;; and so was every consumer through it. The first fix attempted elsewhere in
;; this workspace gave the reader a `:cljs` branch reading `resources/`
;; relative to the working directory, and that was measured wrong the same
;; day: `kotoba-lang/technology` on that pattern returned nil for all 159 of
;; `kotoba.iso3166`'s assertions under nbb, because nbb's cwd was iso3166's
;; root. A portability fix that works only while you are the root project is
;; not one.
;;
;; So the registry is compiled in. There is no read, so there is no read that
;; can fail, and no `readable?` worth keeping — a check with no failure mode
;; is theatre. What is tested instead is the failure mode that now exists:
;; the generated projection drifting from the EDN a human edits.
